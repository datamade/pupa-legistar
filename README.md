## Requirements

* python 2.7
* mongo

## Installation

```console
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> python setup.py install 
```

## Setup

Everything should be set up to run already with this repository, but if you want to change your mongo settings, edit `pupa_settings.py`

## Usage

Make sure you have mongo installed and running.

Init the mongo collection. Default database is `pupa`
```console
pupa init chicago 
```

Run the scraper. This will generate a bunch of static json files in `scraped_data` and stuff them in to the `pupa` database.
```console
pupa update chicago
```
